# Project Name

## Summary

I'm going to build esp32 based smart sunglasses that help blind people get information with ai technologies about what's in front of them. 
If it is text then we will use the ocr model and if it is an object we will use the image classification model.
The purpose of the project is to allow everyone to create the glasses for the other cheaply and not like today a similar product costs about 1200 dollars. 
I like the project because I know that there are people who really need a product in this style and do not necessarily have 1200 usd for an orcam

## Plan

First of all, order the desired ingredients.
After that I will start expanding knowledge about tensorflow and different artificial intelligence models and their use on esp32  . 
I will put all the components together and print a case on a resin 3D printer.
I will create a short program that uses python and recognizes voice commands with the help of voice recognition ai model and then takes a picture and processes it and plays it on the device's speakers. 
Finally, maybe added a user application in swift ui

## Note
Probably I will use tensor flow micro for esp32
I that doesn't work the device will connect to phone for getting data

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
